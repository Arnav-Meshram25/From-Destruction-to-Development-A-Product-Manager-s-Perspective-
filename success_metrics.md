📊 Success Metrics & Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
Rebuilding Hiroshima is not only about restoring structures — it’s about restoring life, confidence, and identity. Below are the key metrics that reflect whether our strategic efforts are truly making a difference in the lives of the people and the soul of the city.

☢️ Radiation Safety Levels
Ensuring the land, air, and water are safe is foundational.
We will closely monitor radiation levels across all districts — not just through lab reports, but by involving citizens in public dashboards and communication.
When parents stop fearing the soil their children play on, we know we’re making progress.

👥 Population Return & Resettlement
A city without its people is just geography.
We will measure how many displaced families are able to return, how quickly housing is rebuilt, and how community life begins to pulse again — with reopened schools, street vendors, and evening temple bells.

🏥 Health & Radiation-Linked Illness Tracking
The scars of nuclear radiation do not fade quickly.
Hospitals and researchers will continue to record cases of long-term radiation illness. But beyond the data, it’s about ensuring survivors get lifelong care and that no one feels forgotten by their government or society.

📈 Local Economic Revival
Markets reopening. Shops buzzing. Workers earning.
We’ll track how local businesses are reopening, whether people are finding work again, and if Hiroshima is once more contributing meaningfully to the country’s economy.
A healthy economy is the backbone of dignity.

✈️ Tourism & Global Attention
Tourism will be a powerful signal — not of curiosity, but of connection.
When people from around the world come to Hiroshima not just to mourn but to learn and reflect, we know we’ve succeeded in telling our story.
Every visitor is a vote for peace.

🏭 Business & Industry Reinvestment
The return of industry signals stability and opportunity.
We'll track how companies — both Japanese and international — begin investing in Hiroshima again, setting up offices, factories, and shops.
It's not about profit, but about long-term belief in the city’s resilience.

🧠 Education, Public Health & Civic Confidence
When children start going back to school. When doctors can treat without shortage. When citizens begin to trust their city again.
We’ll listen to how people feel about safety, governance, and public services.
Rebuilding trust is harder than rebuilding walls — but it's the most important work.
