# From Ashes to Action: A Product Manager’s Strategic Case Study of Hiroshima 💮

## 📍 Overview

This is a product-management-style case study on the city of **Hiroshima**, which was devastated by the world’s first atomic bombing on August 6, 1945.

Rather than just recounting history, this project reimagines how Hiroshima could have been rebuilt with modern strategic thinking — through the lens of a **Product Manager or Business Analyst**. It includes stakeholder mapping, phased intervention plans, economic recovery metrics, and future safeguards.

> _“Hiroshima should not remain a symbol of destruction, but rise as a global model of resilience, peace, and intelligent recovery.”_
