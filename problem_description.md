🧨 Problem Space
On August 6, 1945, at precisely 8:15 AM, the city of Hiroshima was wiped out in mere seconds. An entire urban civilization — its infrastructure, institutions, and communities — was reduced to rubble and radiation. What was once a thriving city of families, students, workers, and culture became a desolate wasteland.

But the problem was not just the destruction of buildings. It was the collapse of human systems — physical, emotional, societal, and political.

🚨 Core Problem Areas:
1. 🧱 Total Infrastructure Failure
Almost every structure in the city — homes, schools, hospitals, government offices — was either instantly destroyed or severely damaged. Roads were blocked with debris, water pipelines burst, and power lines melted. The city’s skeleton no longer existed.

2. ☢️ Radiation Contamination
Even after the explosion, invisible and lethal radiation continued to harm survivors. The levels of exposure were unknown at the time, and the long-term health effects (like cancer and birth defects) would only be understood decades later. Hiroshima became a nuclear experiment without consent.

3. ⚰️ Mass Casualties & Human Trauma
Tens of thousands died instantly. Thousands more suffered horrifying burns, injuries, and trauma. Those who survived watched family members disintegrate or die slow, painful deaths. The city wasn’t just physically destroyed — it was emotionally shattered.

4. 🏛️ Governance Breakdown
With the administrative centers gone and leaders killed or missing, there was no immediate way to organize rescue or response. Decision-making froze. There was no coordination or chain of command — just chaos.

5. 🩺 Collapse of Public Health & Sanitation
Hospitals were destroyed. Doctors were either dead or overwhelmed. Medical supplies didn’t exist. Water was contaminated. Corpses lay in the streets. Disease outbreaks became a major threat within days.

6. 📚 Education System Disruption
All schools were flattened. Thousands of students and teachers were killed. Education, an anchor of stability and hope, disappeared overnight. For children who survived, there was no place to learn, grow, or even be safe.

7. 🌍 Global Perception & Identity Crisis
Hiroshima went from a regional city in Japan to a global symbol of destruction. But in the eyes of the world, it risked being remembered only as a victim — not as a place of innovation, spirit, or human resilience.
