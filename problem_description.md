# Problem Space

On August 6, 1945, the city of Hiroshima was obliterated in seconds. What once was a thriving urban center was reduced to ashes â€” physically, emotionally, and institutionally. 

### ðŸš¨ Core Problem Areas:
1. **Total Infrastructure Failure**
2. **Radiation Contamination**
3. **Mass Casualties & Trauma**
4. **Governance Breakdown**
5. **Public Health & Sanitation Collapse**
6. **Education System Disruption**
7. **Global Perception & Identity Crisis**

### ðŸ§­ Strategic Opportunity:
In crisis lies opportunity. Hiroshima had the chance to become more than just a rebuilt city â€” it could become a symbol of human resilience, peace, and thoughtful reconstruction.
