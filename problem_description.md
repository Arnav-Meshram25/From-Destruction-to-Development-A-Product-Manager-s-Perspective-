🧨 Problem Space
On August 6, 1945, at 8:15 AM, the city of Hiroshima was annihilated in an instant. A thriving urban civilization — of homes, schools, markets, and memories — vanished into ash and radiation.

But the true devastation went beyond physical ruins. Hiroshima experienced a total collapse of human systems — societal, emotional, political, and institutional.

🚨 Core Problem Areas
1. 🧱 Total Infrastructure Failure
Almost every building — from family homes to government offices — was destroyed or damaged beyond use.
Roads were blocked by debris, pipelines burst, and power lines melted. Hiroshima’s physical backbone was gone.

2. ☢️ Radiation Contamination
Even after the explosion, invisible radiation lingered — deadly and poorly understood.
Survivors unknowingly absorbed doses that led to long-term illnesses, cancers, and birth defects.
The city became an unwilling nuclear experiment.

3. ⚰️ Mass Casualties & Human Trauma
Tens of thousands died instantly. Many more suffered unbearable burns and wounds.
Families were erased. Survivors carried physical and emotional scars that would last lifetimes.
The city wasn’t just destroyed — it was psychologically broken.

4. 🏛️ Governance Breakdown
With leaders killed or missing and no communication systems, governance collapsed.
There was no one to organize aid, make decisions, or coordinate survivors.
Chaos and paralysis ruled the immediate aftermath.

5. 🩺 Public Health & Sanitation Collapse
Hospitals were rubble. Doctors were either dead or overwhelmed.
Water was unsafe. Diseases spread rapidly due to lack of sanitation and uncollected corpses.
Healthcare as a system had ceased to exist.

6. 📚 Education System Disruption
All schools were destroyed. Thousands of children and educators perished.
Education — a symbol of hope and continuity — vanished overnight.
For surviving children, there was no safe space to learn or simply be children.

7. 🌍 Global Identity Crisis
Hiroshima became a global symbol of nuclear destruction.
But beyond pity and headlines, it risked being frozen in time — remembered only as a site of tragedy, not resilience.
Its cultural identity teetered between victimhood and global relevance.
