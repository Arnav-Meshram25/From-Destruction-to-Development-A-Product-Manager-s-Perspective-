# Executive Summary

On August 6, 1945, the world witnessed the first wartime use of atomic weaponry as the city of Hiroshima was obliterated in an instant. Tens of thousands of innocent civilians perished, and a vibrant city was reduced to ashes. This case study aims to reimagine the rebuilding of Hiroshima through the lens of a modern-day product strategist — focused not just on reconstruction, but on resilience, peace, and purpose.

This is a three-phase rebuilding roadmap rooted in empathy, data, and design thinking — showing how Hiroshima could rise from devastation and become a model for global peace and recovery.
